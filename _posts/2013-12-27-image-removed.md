As of [28de3ec](https://github.com/progrium/dokku/commit/28de3ecaa3231a223f83fd8d03f373308673bc40) the second parameter (`$IMAGE`) on the `pre-build`, `post-build`, `pre-release`, `post-release`, and `pre-deploy` hooks [were removed to simplify things](https://github.com/progrium/dokku/issues/313).

Affects: master
